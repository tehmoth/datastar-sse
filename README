NAME

    Datastar::SSE - Module for creating Datastar Server Events

DESCRIPTION

    An implementation of the Datastar <https://data-star.dev/> Server Sent
    Event SDK in Perl

SYNOPSIS

        use Datastar::SSE :merge_modes;
    
            my @events;
            push @events,  Datastar::SSE->merge_fragments( $html_fragment, +{
            selector => '#name-selector',
            merge_mode => FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_OUTER,
        });
        # $event is a multiline string which should be sent as part of
        # the http response body.  Multiple event strings can be sent in the same response.
            for my $evt (@events) {
                    $cgi->print( $evt ); # CGI
                    $psgi_writer->write( $evt ); # PSGI delayed response "writer"
                    $c->write( $evt ); # Mojolicious controller
            }

 fragment_merge_modes

    The Merge Modes for the "merge_fragments" event:

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODEMORPH

      morph

      Merges the fragment using Idiomorph
      <https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph>. This is the default
      merge strategy.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_INNER

      inner

      Replaces the target’s innerHTML with the fragment.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_OUTER

      outer

      Replaces the target’s outerHTML with the fragment.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_PREPEND

      prepend

      Prepends the fragment to the target’s children.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_APPEND

      append

      Appends the fragment to the target’s children.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_BEFORE

      before

      Inserts the fragment before the target as a sibling.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_AFTER

      after

      Inserts the fragment after the target as a sibling.

      * FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_UPSERTATTRIBUTES

      upsertAttributes

      Merges attributes from the fragment into the target – useful for
      updating a signal.

METHODS

 headers

            ->headers();

    Returns an Array Ref of the recommended headers to sent for Datastar
    SSE responses.

            Content-Type: text/event-stream
            Cache-Control: no-cache
            Connection: keep-alive
            Keep-Alive: timeout=300, max=100000

EVENTS

    Each Datastar SSE event is implements as a class method on
    Datastar::SSE. Each method accepts, but does not require, an options
    hashref as the last parameter, the options are documented per event,
    additionally all options from HTTP::ServerEvent are supported.

      * id

      The event id. If you send this, a client will send the
      "Last-Event-Id" header when reconnecting, allowing you to send the
      events missed while offline. Newlines or null characters in the event
      id are treated as a fatal error.

      * retry

      the amount of miliseconds to wait before reconnecting if the
      connection is lost. Newlines or null characters in the retry interval
      are treated as a fatal error.

 merge_fragments

            ->merge_fragments( $html_fragment, $options_hashref );
            ->merge_fragments( $html_fragment_arrayref, $options_hashref );

    datastar-merge-fragments
    <https://data-star.dev/reference/sse_events#datastar-merge-fragments>

    Merges one or more fragments into the DOM. By default, Datastar merges
    fragments using Idiomorph
    <https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph>, which matches top level
    elements based on their ID.

  OPTIONS

      * selector

      Str

      Selects the target element of the merge process using a CSS selector.

      * use_view_transition

      Bool

      Default: 0

      Sends As: useViewTransition

      Whether to use view transitions when merging into the DOM.

      * merge_mode

      Str|MERGEMODE

      Default: FRAGMENT_MERGEMODE_MORPH

      Sends As: mergeMode

      The mode to use when merging into the DOM.

      See merge modes

 merge_signals

            ->merge_signals( $signals_hashref, $options_hashref );

    datastar-merge-signals
    <https://data-star.dev/reference/sse_events#datastar-merge-signals>

    Updates the signals with new values. The only_if_missing option
    determines whether to update the signals with new values only if the
    key does not exist. The signals line should be a valid data-signals
    attribute. This will get merged into the signals.

  OPTIONS

      * only_if_missing

      Bool

      Default: 0

      Sends As: onlyIfMissing

      Only update the signals with new values if the key does not exist.

 remove_fragments

            ->remove_fragments( $selector, $options_hashref )

    datastar-remove-fragments
    <https://data-star.dev/reference/sse_events#datastar-remove-fragments>

    Removes one or more HTML fragments that match the provided selector
    ($selector) from the DOM.

 remove_signals

            ->remove_signals( @paths, $options_hashref )
            ->remove_signals( $paths_arrayref, $options_hashref )

    datastar-remove-signals
    <https://data-star.dev/reference/sse_events#datastar-remove-signals>

    Removes signals that match one or more provided paths (@paths).

 execute_script

            ->execute_script( $script, $options_hashref )
            ->execute_script( $script_arrayref, $options_hashref )

    datastar-execute-script
    <https://data-star.dev/reference/sse_events#datastar-execute-script>

    Executes JavaScript ($script or @$script_arrayref) in the browser.

  OPTIONS

      * auto_remove

      Bool

      Default: 1

      Sends As: autoRemove

      Determines whether to remove the script element after execution.

      * attributes

      Map[Name,Value]

      CycleTuple[ Str | Map[Name,Value] ]

      Default: [{ type => 'module' }]

      Each attribute adds an HTML attribute to the <script> tag used for
      the script, in either name='value' or name format.

      The attributes option can be one of

	* A HashRef of keys and values, with boolean attributes (attributes
	without a value), as a false value

                options => {
                        type => 'script',
                        async => 0,
                        defer => 0,
                        class => 'my-script',
                },

	* An ArrayRef of key,value pairs as Hashrefs, and simple strings
	for boolean attributes

                options => [
                        { type => 'script' },
                        'async',
                        'defer',
                        { class => 'my-script' },
                ];

    All events return the falsey empty string () when they cannot generate
    an event string.
